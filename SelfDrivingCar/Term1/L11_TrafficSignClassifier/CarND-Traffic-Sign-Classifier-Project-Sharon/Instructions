Lab: LeNet in TensorFlow
LeNet. Source: Yann Lecun.
LeNet. Source: Yann Lecun.
You're now going to put together everything you've learned and implement the LeNet architecture using TensorFlow.

When you get to your next project, remember that LeNet can be a great starting point for your network architecture!

Instructions:
git clone https://github.com/udacity/CarND-LeNet-Lab.git
cd CarND-LeNet-Lab
conda env create -f environment.yml
source activate CarND-LeNet-Lab
juypter notebook
Finish off the architecture implementation in the LeNet function. That's the only piece that's missing.
Preprocessing
An MNIST image is initially 784 features (1D). We reshape this to (28, 28, 1) (3D), normalize such that the values are between 0-1 instead of 0-255, and finally, pad the image with 0s such that the height and width are 32 (centers digit further). Thus, the input shape going into the first convolutional layer is 32x32x1.

Specs
Convolution layer 1. The output shape should be 28x28x6.

Activation 1. Your choice of activation function.

Pooling layer 1. The output shape should be 14x14x6.

Convolution layer 2. The output shape should be 10x10x16.

Activation 2. Your choice of activation function.

Pooling layer 2. The output shape should be 5x5x16.

Flatten layer. Flatten the output shape of the final pooling layer such that it's 1D instead of 3D. The easiest way to do is by using tf.contrib.layers.flatten, which is already imported for you.

Fully connected layer 1. This should have 120 outputs.

Activation 3. Your choice of activation function.

Fully connected layer 2. This should have 10 outputs.

You'll return the result of the 2nd fully connected layer from the LeNet function.

If implemented correctly you should see output similar to the following:

Parameters Galore
As an additional fun exercise calculate the total number of parameters used by the network. Note, the convolutional layers use weight sharing!
